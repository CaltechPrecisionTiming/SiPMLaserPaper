\section{Introduction}

Scintillating materials are widely used in detectors of ionizing radiation. 
They a very common as primary sensor in calorimetric application, either serving also as an absorber material such 
as solid crystals of plastic scintillators or in combination with passiv absorbers in a layered arrangement, referred to as sampling calorimeters. To convert the primary scintillation light signal into electrical signal a photo detector is coupled to the scintiallator volume.
Silicon Photo Multipliers (SiPM) are a common choice as a photo detector in todays applications.
In this paper we present studies on SiPMs and scintillator based detectors with SiPM readout wiht a focus on precise timing measurements for ionizing radiation.
