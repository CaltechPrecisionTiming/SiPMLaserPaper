\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Scintillating materials are widely used in detectors of ionizing radiation. They
are very common as primary sensors in calorimetric applications, either serving
simultaneously as an absorber material, such as solid crystals, or in
combination with passive absorbers in a layered arrangement, referred to as
sampling calorimeters. Scintillators are also used to detect charged particles
where they achieve a very high efficiency with a layer of thickness of about a
few millimeters. LYSO has been proposed as a scintillating crystal for future
calorimeters due to its large scintillation light yield~\cite{LYSOProperties,
Yang:2015nsa}. To convert the primary scintillation light signal into an
electrical signal a photodetector is coupled to the scintillator volume, either
directly or via a light guiding structure. Silicon Photo Multipliers (SiPM) are
a common choice as a photodetector in contemporary applications. In this paper
we present studies on SiPMs and a LYSO-based sampling calorimeter with
SiPM readout with a focus on precise timing measurements. 

Precise time of arrival measurements have recently drawn much attention in the 
context of detector R\&D for the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron 
Collider (HL-LHC) as well as for future high energy hadron colliders.  
These hadron colliders must provide large 
instantaneous luminosity well above $10^{35}$~$\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
With current accelerator and particle detector capabilities, such a high 
instantaneous luminosity will result in very large amounts
of simultaneous particle collisions (pileup) exceeding several hundreds per
bunch crossing. Therefore, the crucial ability to identify the origin 
of the particles produced at the different interaction points will be severely 
degraded. Precision timing detectors can be used to recover the ability to 
discriminate between particles produced by different inelastic collisions \cite{adielba}.
For particle beams with bunch profiles similar to that of the LHC, a detector 
that can measure the time of arrival of all final state particles 
with a precision of $20-30$~ps can effectively reduce the impact of
pileup by a factor of $5$ to $10$. 

With a timing resolution below $10$~ps for individual charged particles, the
equivalent spatial resolution is sufficiently good to improve the performance of
track reconstruction \cite{Neri:2016bng} for hadron collider experiments. A timing
resolution in the picosecond range for photons is also very interesting for optical time
projection chambers which are discussed for large volume detectors in neutrino
experiments and neutrino-less double-beta decay~\cite{Aberle:2013jba, otpc}. 

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:sipm} we give a brief
overview of the SiPM sensors in the context of our research. In
Sec.~\ref{sec:setup} we describe the experimental techniques we employ in our
precision timing measurements as well as the specific setups we used for the
studies presented in this paper. In Sec.~\ref{sec:beamtiming} we present the
results of timing measurements using SiPMs as photodetectors to read out
scintillation light from LYSO crystals exposed to electrons in the GeV energy
range. In Sec.~\ref{sec:lasertiming} we evaluate the impact of the intrinsic
timing performance of SiPM devices on the calorimeter time measurement by
measuring the time resolution for SiPMs injected with light from a fast laser.
