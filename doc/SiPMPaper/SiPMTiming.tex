\begin{abstract}
Particle detectors based on scintillation light are particularly well suited for precision timing applications with 
resolutions of a few 10 ps. The large primary signal and the fast initial rise of the scintillation
light result in very favorable signal-to-noise conditions with fast signals. In this paper we describe timing 
studies using a LYSO-based sampling calorimeter with wavelength-shifting capillary light extraction and silicon
photo multipliers as sensors. We study the contributions of various steps of the signal generation to 
the total time resolution, and demonstrate its feasibility as a radiation-hard technology for calorimeters
at high intensity hadron colliders.

\section{Timing Measurements} 

A previous study on precision timing with LYSO-based calorimeters
\cite{Anderson:2015gha} using micro-channel plate photomultipliers (MCP-PMT) 
as the primary photo-detectors achieved time resolutions at the level of 
about $100$~ps. In this paper, we present new studies of the
timing performance of LYSO-based calorimeters using silicon multi-pixel 
photon counters (SiPM). While SiPMs feature a rise time around
$1$~ns, slower than the rise time of MCPs, they allow a very good timing
performance for large, coherent signals. In subsection
~\ref{sec:beamtiming} we describe measurements of the timing performance 
for a LYSO-based sampling calorimeter read out by wavelength-shifting 
light fibers connected to SiPMs. In subsection~\ref{sec:lasertiming}
we discuss the impact of the intrinsic timing performance of SiPMs on 
the calorimeter timing measurement studied using light signals injected
by a picosecond laser.
