\section{Summary}

We have presented test-beam measurements of the timing performance of a
LYSO-based sampling calorimeter read out via four wavelength shifting fibers
optically coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Time resolutions at the
level of $60$~ps is achieved for beam energies above $100$~GeV for individual
fibers and SiPMs. Combining all four fibers yield time resolution measurements
of about $42$~ps. Using laser light injected directly onto SiPMs, we have
demonstrated that the impact of the intrinsic time resolution of the SiPM
devices is small and that the calorimeter time resolution is dominated by the
impact of the wavelength shifter. Finally, we have shown that the use of quartz
capillaries do not degrade the time resolution beyond the impact from a reduced
signal amplitude. Therefore it is feasible that this radiation-hard solution
using quartz capillaries can achieve the desired $30$~ps time resolution
performance if additional improvements in light collection efficiency can be
achieved.
