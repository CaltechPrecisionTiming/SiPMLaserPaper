\section{SiPM}
\label{sec:sipm}

Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) are pixelated photodetectors that are widely
used in contemporary high-energy physics experiments. Their compactness and form
factor make them ideal for many applications including calorimeters, charged
particle detectors, and PET detectors. The size of each SiPM device typically
ranges between $1\times 1$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ and $6\times 6$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$,
with the size of each pixel ranging between $10\mu$m to $50\mu$m. SiPMs operate
at relatively high gain between $10^{5}$ and $10^{6}$, and have single photon detection
efficiency ranging from $10\%$ to $50\%$. As each pixel operates in geiger mode, it is essentially a digital
device. More than one photon impinging on a single pixel yields the same signal
as a single photon impinging on that pixel. Therefore as the number of photons
approaches the total number of pixels, the SiPM experiences a slow saturation as
the signal response slowly becomes non-linear. Total saturation occurs 
if the number of photons exceed the number of pixels in the device. 


SiPMs have a typical thermal dark count rate of about $1$~MHz, which can be
strongly decreased when operated at lower temperatures. Typical operational
temperatures range from $20$ to $30$ degrees Celsius, but can be as low as $-30$
degrees Celsius. SiPMs have been tested for the impact of radiation damage up to
an equivalent neutron rate of $2\times10^{14}$~$\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and its
performance have been shown to be robust when operated at temperatures below 
$5$~degrees Celsius.~\cite{SiPMIrradiated1,SiPMIrradiated2}. 
However, when operated at the same temperature, the thermal dark count rate increases
significantly with large irradiation.

The SiPMs used for our studies are Hamamatsu MPPC S12571-010P and S12571-015P both of 
size $1\times1\mathrm{mm}^{2}$, and S12572-15C and S12572-25C both of size 
$3\times3\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. Some relevant details of the SiPM parameters
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:SiPMParameters} below.
